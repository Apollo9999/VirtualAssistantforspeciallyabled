Project motive and objective is to justify for specially abled  persons.As of 2020, over 1 billion people are visually impaired.
We see this as an opportunity and addressing  to make a social justice to people, assisting them to make healthier and more life-conscious decisions.
.So Virtual Assistant helps to  sort out the below issues in writing examinations.


1)It is very difficult for a specially abled persons, specially abled persons or person with his hands paralysed to find a scribe who could write the exam for him/her. Most people are busy in their day to day life and therefore blind people waste a considerable amount of time in finding a scribe thus wasting their precious time. Also the scribes come with their own problems. 

2)Their writing may not be legible. 

3)They may not be technically sound in the field so may end up writing something different from   what  the examinee may have dictated. 

4)There could be a conflict of interest between the scribe and the examinee which is difficult to establish.

5)Linguistic limitation.
6)Poor availability.
7)Not reliable.
8)Money has to be paid to the scribe after each exam becomes difficult for poor students.

9)No initiative taken by the education boards to provide a Scribe responsibility falls on the student to get their own scribes.


******Approach to solution********

1)Our approach to solving this problem is introducing a new examination system which does not require a scribe. The application that we intend to create leverages the power of voice recognition and speech to text technology. 

2)The specially abled persons can give simple voice commands like "go to next question", "read out current question", "read out the answer I wrote" to perform the appropriate tasks. The specially abled persons can also give the answer to a particular question using his voice. 

3)The system could also work for MCQ type questions. The whole system of examination will be voice controlled and there is no need for an external scribe in such an environment


*******Explanation of SOLUTION*************
1)The specially abled persons who wishes to take the exam can login using fingerprint recognition or facial recognition which is employed in a lot of exam centres.
 
2)As on when the examination starts, the specially abled persons can ask simple questions like "what is the current question", "how much time is left", etc., to get information about the exam. 

3)For writing the answer, the specially abled persons has two options; Either he/she could type the answer using the keyboard (if possible) or could give the answer using his/her voice. 

4)This process does not require a scribe and can be taken up by a specially abled persons person independently.
